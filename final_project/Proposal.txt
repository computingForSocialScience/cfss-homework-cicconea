What: My thesis project is on the optimal transition time of the CO2 emitting
electricity sector to a low-emitting technology. Given a fixed energy demand
in a region, and a mix of high-emitting and low-emitting capital that supplies
electricity, I model the lowest-cost transition from high emitting to low 
according to the following constraints. Both capital stocks depreciate
linearly at rate 1/n, and can be replaced by high-emitting (coal/gas) or 
low-emitting (wind/solar) infrastructure investment over a period of n years. 
We are subjected to a carbon emissions cap, and exogenenously determined
efficiency vectors. The full math for this model can be viewed here:

Why: This project is important because it bridges the technical literature on
required investments in clean energy to avoid damaging climate change and the 
economic optimization of existing electricity-generating assets. 

How: I have code written to perform this optimization using the pulp library
for linear programming in python. My website will allow the user to select
several exogenous parameters as well as the carbon budget and timing over 
which we perform the optimization. Several key graphs will be plotted and 
displayed either statically or generated with javascript D3 if I can figure
it out.
